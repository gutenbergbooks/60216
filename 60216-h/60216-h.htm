<h1>IRISH YARNS<br />
No. 2</h1>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">ON JUDGMENT DAY.</p>

<p>A certain priest and a parishioner were visiting
one night and judgment day was mentioned.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean, ‘judgment’ day?” the
man inquired.</p>

<p>“Judgment day,” replied the priest, “is
the day when all who have died are brought
up for judgment, when their sins are judged
and the verdict—judgment—is pronounced.”</p>

<p>“Aha,” exclaimed the man. “And will
the A. P. A.’s be there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the A. P. A.’s will be there.”</p>

<p>“Will the Ancient Order of Hibernians be
there?”</p>

<p>“They certainly will! Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m thinking there’ll be mighty little
‘judging’ done the first few hours, thin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pat—“That McGinty is a fine fellow.”</p>

<p>Mick—“Is he?”</p>

<p>Pat—“He is, indeed. Great friend of mine.
Did you notice how heartily he shook hands
with me?”</p>

<p>Mick—“I did.”</p>

<p>Pat—“Great friend of mine. He wasn’t
satisfied with shaking one hand, but he
grabbed hold of both.”</p>

<p>Mick—“I suppose he thought his watch
and chain would be safer that way.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">EASY FOR PADDY.</p>

<p>At a political meeting an Irishman watched
closely the trombone player in the band.
Presently the man laid down his instrument
and went out for a beer. Paddy investigated,
and promptly pulled the horn to pieces. The
player returned. “Who’s meddled mit my
drombone?” he roared. “Oi did,” said
Paddy. “Here ye’ve been for two hours
tryin’ to pull it apart, an’ Oi did it in wan
minute!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mike—“What a red nose that Sweeney has.”</p>

<p>“Whist, man; he spint a barrel of money
to get it to the pink of perfection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was in the wilds of Tipperary, and the local
and long-suffering landlord had been ill-advised
enough to ask for a bit of rent on account—the
same being some few years overdue.
Roused to fury at this unlooked-for
and, in their eyes, outrageous demand, Mike
and Pat decided to “wait for” the base and
greedy tyrant. And they did—behind a
hedge with a shot-gun. An hour passed.
Their feet and their fingers were numbed
with the cold, and, worse than that, the
dhrop or half-bottle of the crathur was gone.</p>

<p>Said Pat to Mike, in a hoarse whisper:
“Shure, an’ I hope nothing can have happened
to the onfortunate gintleman!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not long ago a young Irishman was seeking
work in western Illinois, and among
those to whom he applied was a farmer near
Cairo.</p>

<p>The farmer was attracted by the Celt’s
frank, cheery manner, and, while he was not
in need of help, he asked, after a pause:</p>

<p>“Can you cradle?”</p>

<p>“Cradle!” repeated the Irishman. “Sure,
I can! But, sir,” he added persuasively,
“couldn’t ye give me a job out of dures?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Murphy—“Oi hear yer brother-in-law,
Pat Keegan, is pretty bad off.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Casey—“Shure, he’s good for a year
yit.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy—“As long as that?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Casey—“Yes; he’s had four different
doctors, and each one uv thim gave him three
months to live.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Dundee shopkeeper asked an Irishman
who was standing at a street corner if he
wanted a job.</p>

<p>“Yes, sor,” replied the Irishman.</p>

<p>“Well, now, what would you take to clear
the snow away from my premises?”</p>

<p>“A shovel, sor!” was the sharp reply of
the Irishman.</p>

<p>He got the job.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">A SAVING, ANYWAY.</p>

<p>O’Brien—“So the landlord lowered the rint
for yez. He’ll save money at that.”</p>

<p>Casey—“How so?”</p>

<p>O’Brien—“Shure, it’s less he’ll be losin’
when ye don’t pay it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">MAKING GOOD USE OF HIM.</p>

<p>An Italian organ-grinder possessed a monkey
which he “worked” through the summer
months. When the cool days came his
business fell off, and he discontinued his
walks and melodies. An Irishman of his acquaintance
offered him half a dollar a week for
the privilege of keeping and feeding the little
beast. The bargain was made for a month.</p>

<p>Great curiosity filled the mind of the Italian,
and at last he went ostensibly to see his pet,
but really to find out what possible use Pat
could make of the monkey.</p>

<p>The Irishman was frank. “It’s loike this,”
he said. “Oi put up a pole in the back yard,
with the monkey on the top. Ten or twelve
trains of cars loaded with coal go by here
every evenin’. There’s men on every car.
Every man takes a heave at the monk. Divil
a wan has hit him, but Oi have sivin tons of
coal.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">PRETTY LOUD.</p>

<p>An Irishman came to a doctor complaining
that he had noises in his head.</p>

<p>“Oi have them all the time,” he said,
“an’ sometimes Oi can hear thim fifty feet
away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Phwat koind av a room would yez loike
to hov, sor? Oi can giv’ yez a back room
in the front av th’ house, or a front room in
th’ back av th’ house jist to suit yer inconvaynience;
or Oi can giv’ yez number sixty-six
or ninety-nine, jist to suit yer inconvaynience—No.
66 is th’ broidle chamber, but
we kape th’ broidle out in th’ shtable.</p>

<p>“Oi can giv’ yez another lovely room in th’
middle av the front av th’ hotel, sor—it’s a
lovely place; there do be carpet on th’ floor;
air cushion sofys an’ bir-rds-eye maple chif’niers
an’ runnin’ hot an’ cold wather passin’
th’ door, whoile th’ bath-tubs are always
supplied wid gold fish; th’ room is loighted
wid indecent lamps thot are supplied wid electricity,
bur-rnin’ noight an’ day in th’ shtreet,
an’ a tooth-brush in ivery room.”</p>

<p>“Say, Mr. Clerk, there’s a lady without!”</p>

<p>“Widout phwat; widout phwat?”</p>

<p>“Without here, in the hall, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; show her up in th’ parlor;
Oi’ll be up in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Say, Mr. Clerk, there’s a man upstairs in
room 78, says there’s bedbugs in his bed!”</p>

<p>“Phwat! Bedbugs in his bed? Go up and
ask him if he wants humming bir-ds in his
bed fer a dollar a day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, Mr. Clerk, there’s a man upstairs in
room 97 who says the rain came through the
skylight last night and wet him to the skin.”</p>

<p>“Wet him to th’ skin; charge him 25 cents
extra fer th’ bath. G’wan out av here!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Caller—“Your master’s not at home, eh,
Pat?”</p>

<p>Pat—“No, sor; he do be in the ould country
these t’ree wakes, sor.”</p>

<p>Caller—“Excuse me, Pat, but how is it
when your mistress is on this side of the water
master’s on the other, and vice versa?
Is there trouble between them?”</p>

<p>Pat—“None at all, sor; only they have
agrade bechune ’em that they can live together
better when they’re apart.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Prisoner—“There goes my hat. Shall
I run after it?”</p>

<p>Officer Casey—“Phwat? Run away and
never come back again? Not on your life.
You stand here and I’ll run after your hat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">PRECAUTION.</p>

<p>Mrs. Casey—“Me sister writes me that
every bottle in the box we sent her was
broken. Are you sure yez printed ‘This
side up with care’ on it?”</p>

<p>Casey—“Oi am. An’ for fear they shouldn’t
see it on the top Oi printed it on the bottom
as well.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">DANGER!</p>

<p>An Irishman visiting a friend in the hospital
began to take an interest in the other
patients.</p>

<p>“What are you in here for?” he asked
one.</p>

<p>“I’ve got tonsillitis, and I’ve got to have
my tonsils cut out,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“And you?” he asked another.</p>

<p>“I’ve got blood poisoning in my arm, and
they are going to cut it off,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” said Pat, in horror, “This
ain’t no place for me. I’ve got a cold in my
head.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Mike, did you ever catch frogs?” “Yes,
sor.” “What did you bait with?” “Bate
’em with a shtick, sor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>People that take all things literally are apt
to tread on other people’s toes. The Irishman
who walked in where he saw a sign,
“Walk in,” and who was ordered out by the
lawyer was a literal man, and so was the man
that went into a pawnbroker’s shop and demanded
ten dollars because there was a placard
in the window that read,“Look at this
watch for ten dollars.”</p>

<p>“I looked at it,” said he, “and now I
want my ten dollars.”</p>

<p>The most amusing incident we have heard
is that of the countryman who, while sauntering
along a city street, saw a sign, “Please
ring the bell for the janitor.”</p>

<p>After reflecting a few minutes he walked
up and gave the bell such a pull that it nearly
came out by the roots.</p>

<p>In a few minutes an angry-faced man
opened the door.</p>

<p>“Are you the janitor?” asked the bell-puller.</p>

<p>“Yes; what do you want?”</p>

<p>“I saw that notice, so I rang the bell for
you, and now I want to know why you can’t
ring the bell yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An Irishman wanted to sell a dog, but the
prospective buyer was suspicious, and finally
decided not to buy. The man then told him
why he was anxious to sell. “You see,” said
he, “I bought the dog and thrained him
myself. I got him so he’d bark all the time
if a person stepped inside the gate, and I
thought I was safe from burglars. Then me
woife wanted me to thrain him to carry
bundles—and I did. If you put anything
into his mouth, the spalpeen’d keep it there
till some one took it away. Well one night I
woke up and heard some one in the next room.
I got up and grabbed me gun. They were
there, three of the blackguards and the dog.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he bark,” interrupted the other.</p>

<p>“Sorra a bark,” was the reply, “he was
too busy.”</p>

<p>“Busy,” asked the other, “what doing?”</p>

<p>“Carrying the lantern for the burglars,”
answered the Irishman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">NO NEED TO TELL.</p>

<p>Casey (rolling up his sleeves)—“Did you
tell Reilly Oi was a liar?”</p>

<p>Murphy—“Oi did not. Oi thought he
knew it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paddy Dolan bought a watch from the local
jeweller with a guaranty to keep it in order
for twelve months. About six months
after, Paddy took it back because it had
stopped.</p>

<p>“You seem to have had an accident with
it,” said the jeweller.</p>

<p>“A small one, sure enough, sir. About
two months ago I was feeding the pig and it
fell into the trough.”</p>

<p>“But you should have brought it before.”</p>

<p>“Sure, your honor, I brought it as soon as
I could. We only killed the pig yesterday.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Kathleen had been put out to service, and
her mistress liked the rosy face of the young
girl. One day Kathleen was sent on an errand
to town. She was longer than usual
and her mistress stood on the porch as she
came through the field. Kathleen was happy
and her mistress observed:</p>

<p>“Why, Kathleen, what a rosy face you
have to-day! You look as if the dew had
kissed you.”</p>

<p>Kathleen dropped her eyes and murmured:</p>

<p>“Indeed, ma’am, but that wasn’t his
name!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An Irishman, who couldn’t read, went into
a restaurant and sat down opposite a man
who had a bill of fare in his hands, and concluded
to order whatever the other man ordered
in order not to betray his disordered
learning.</p>

<p>Stranger—“I will have a plate of soup.”</p>

<p>Pat—“Give me th’ same.”</p>

<p>Stranger—“And some oysters.”</p>

<p>Pat—“Give me th’ same.”</p>

<p>The stranger ordered what he wanted,
and Pat duplicated the order. Finally, the
stranger told the waiter to order him a bootblack.</p>

<p>“Give me the same,” said Pat.</p>

<p>“Won’t one do for both of you?”</p>

<p>Pat answered—“No, one won’t; if he can’t
eat one, I can!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Why did you leave your last place?” the
housekeeper asked of the new would-be cook.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, mum, I just couldn’t stand
the way the master an’ the missus used to
quarrel, mum.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! Do you mean to say that
they actually used to quarrel?”</p>

<p>“Yis, mum, all the time. When it wasn’t
me an’ him, it was me and her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A gentleman was put out of patience by
some blunder of Paddy, his new groom.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he cried in his anger; “I
won’t have things done in this way. Do
you think I’m a fool?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say, sir,” answered Paddy; “I
only came here yesterday.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">ONE OF THE SIGHTS.</p>

<p>A man was visiting Ireland for the first
time. In Dublin one warm afternoon he put
his handkerchief over his nose and said, in a
choked voice, “What the deuce is that?”</p>

<p>“That?” said his Irish guide. “Why,
that’s the river Liffey. Didn’t ye know,
man, that the smell o’ the Liffey was one o’
the sights o’ Dublin?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A little Irishman was being examined for
admission to the army. He seemed all right
in every way except one. The doctor said:
“You’re a little stiff.”</p>

<p>Quickly his Irish blood mounted and he replied:
“You’re a big stiff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">NOT HIS NAME.</p>

<p>In Dublin a zealous policeman caught a cab
driver in the act of driving recklessly. The
officer stopped him and said:</p>

<p>“What’s yer name?”</p>

<p>“You’d better try to find out,” said the
driver peevishly.</p>

<p>“Sure, and I will,” said the policeman as
he went around to the side of the cab where
the name ought to have been painted, but the
letters had been rubbed off.</p>

<p>“Aha!” cried the officer. “Now ye’ll git
yerself into worse disgrace than ever. Yer
name seems to be oblitherated.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong!” shouted the driver triumphantly.
“’Tis O’Sullivan.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">NATURAL HISTORY.</p>

<p>They were looking at the kangaroo at the
zoo when an Irishman said:</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sor, phwat kind of a crature
is that?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the gentleman, “that is a native
of Australia.”</p>

<p>“Good hivins!” exclaimed Pat; “an’ me
sister married wan e’ thim.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A wizened little Irishman applied for a job
loading a ship. At first they said he was too
small, but he finally persuaded them to give him
a trial. He seemed to be making good, until
they gradually increased the size of his load
until on the last trip he was carrying a 300-pound
anvil under each arm. When he was
half-way across the gangplank it broke and
the Irishman fell in. With a great splashing
and sputtering he came to the surface.</p>

<p>“T’row me a rope!” he shouted, and again
sank. A second time he rose to the surface.
“T’row me a rope. I say!” he shouted again.
Once more he sank. A third time he rose
struggling.</p>

<p>“Say!” he spluttered angrily, “if one uv
you shpalpeens don’t hurry up an’ t’row me
a rope I’m goin’ to drop one uv these damn
t’ings!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">THE LAST OF THE CARRS.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nora Mulvaney met her old friend,
Mrs. Bridget Carr, carrying in her arms her
twelfth child.</p>

<p>“Arrah, now, Bridget,” said Nora, “an’ there
ye are wid another little Carr in yer arms.”</p>

<p>“Another it is, Mrs. Mulvaney,” replied
her friend, “an’ I’m hopin’ ’tis the caboose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mike sat busily engaged in copying the
names of the male population of the immediate
vicinity. His good wife, noting the apparent
industry of her lord, asked what he
was doing.</p>

<p>“Begorra, an’ it’s wroitin’ the names o’
the min phwat Oi kin lick, so Oi am!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the woman put on her
shawl and went to Pat O’Leary’s humble
home, where she informed Pat that she saw
his name on the list.</p>

<p>Without waiting to don his coat, O’Leary
sallied forth in search of Mike, who was
found still engaged at the list.</p>

<p>“Moike,” said Pat, in a tone that sounded

<p>O’Brien died, and at the wake his friends got
filled up with good whiskey. They finally took
O’Brien’s body down to Kelly’s saloon and
sat it in a chair at a table and drank his health.
After several rounds they left the place, forgetting
O’Brien’s body, which they left sitting
at the table where they had placed it.
Kelly wanted to close up, so he walked over to
O’Brien and shook him, trying to wake him
up. Failing in his efforts to arouse him, he became
angry, and securing a club from behind
the bar, smashed O’Brien over the head with
it. O’Brien fell to the floor, and just at that
moment his friends came back to get the
corpse, having remembered him. They pretended
to be horrified, and charged Kelly

<p>“We never needed any of them new-fangled
scales in Ireland,” said O’Hara. “There’s an
aisy way to weigh a pig without scales. You
get a plank and put it across a stool. Then
you get a big stone. Put the pig on one end
of the plank and the stone on the other end,
and shift the plank until they balance. Then
you guess the weight of the stone and you have
the weight of the pig.”</p>

<p>The Irishman was walking along the bank of

that day he had a dispute with a neighbor over
the ownership of a pig. Suddenly a cry for

a man struggling in the water.</p>

<p>Seeing Mike on the bank, the man in the
water waved his hand and shouted:</p>

<p>“Hey, mate, drope me a line!”</p>

<p>In a flash the man on the bank recognized
his adversary in the pig dispute. Thrusting his
hands in his pockets he made to resume his

<p>“Shure, but there ain’t no post offices where

<p>A ganger on one of our large lines of railways

The “boss” looked disgustedly at

<p>“Slape on, ye lazy spalpeen, slape on, fur

switch attendant did not answer him. Pat
shouted again, but received no answer.</p>

<p>The lady of the Post Office opened the door
and told him to shout a little louder, which he
did, but still no answer.</p>

<p>Again she said he would require to speak

<p>Pat got angry at this, and, turning to the

<p>In the court-house an Irishman stood charged
with stealing a watch from a fellow citizen. He
stoutly denied the impeachment, and brought a
counter-accusation against his accuser for assault
and battery committed with a frying-pan.
The judge was inclined to take a common sense
view of the case, and regarding the prisoner,
said, “Why did you allow the prosecutor, who
is a smaller man than yourself, to assault you,
without resistance? Had you nothing in your
hand to defend yourself with?” “Bedad, your

<p>Pat had seen nearly every clock in the place,
but had discarded all of them as not being good
enough for his purpose. The weary shopman
had exhausted his whole stock, except a few
cuckoo clocks, so he brought these forward as
a last resource, and vowed he would do his best
to sell one or know the reason why.</p>

<p>“Do the clocks strike the hour?” asked Pat,
noticing their curious shape, and half doubting
their capacity to do anything.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you what they do,” said the salesman;
and he set the hands of one to a few minutes
to twelve. When the little door flew open
and the cuckoo thrust his head out, cuckooing
away for dear life, Pat was thunderstruck. But
when the bird disappeared he looked glum, and
pondered in gloomy thought for a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, how do you like that?” asked the
salesman. “That’s a staggerer for you, isn’t
